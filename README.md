# testAssignment
An assignment to test a candidate

There are 3 parts in this assignment.

1. Create an application to insert data (using post request) of 4 fields of your choice(e.g. - your name,roll no,etc.) in a database table using REST API.
There is no need to create a fancy UI. Just a simple form with the above 4 fields will work. So, there will be 2 parts of the application. The frontend part of the application containing the form and the backend part where you will create rest API to insert data in a database table.

2. Display the data using a get request (after insertion into the table) from the database in a table format just below the Form.
The table should look something like this :

3. Create a pdf document(downloadable) on click of a button which displays the above table.
Use the below image as a reference and where in part a you should have your name and roll number and in part b you will display the heading and data in columns for the four fields.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can push your code in this repository and maintain 2 different folders for the frontend and backend part. You can build the frontend part of the application using Angular or React and the backend part using Node.js. Along with the code please make a separate folder which would contain screenshots (of your running application) that you would take after completing each part.
NOTE: The above image is just for reference how the pdf document should look. Instead of column names like patient name , health# just use the name of the fields you used above.
