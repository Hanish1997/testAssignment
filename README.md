# testAssignment
An assignment to test a candidate

There are 3 parts in this assignment.

1. Create an application to insert data (using post request) of 4 fields in a database table using REST API.
There is no need to create a fancy UI. Just a simple form with the above 4 fields will work. So, there will be 2 parts of the application. The frontend part of the application containing the form and the backend part where you will create rest API to insert data in a database table.

2. Display the data using a get request (after insertion into the table) from the database in a table format just below the Form.
3. Create a pdf document(downloadable) on click of a button which displays the above table.
Use the below image as a reference and where in part a you should have your name and roll number and in part b you will display the heading and data in columns for the four fields.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

You can push your code in this repository and maintain 2 different folders for the frontend and backend part. You can build the frontend part of the application using Angular or React and the backend part using Node.js
NOTE: The above image is just for reference how the pdf document should look. Instead of column names like patient name , health# just use the name of the fields you used above.
